# Specifications

TODO: Just throwing down a place holder, but I will come back and flesh this out soon.

The specification tests here are named to coincide with the ticket number from issues reported against this repo.

See the [quickstart walkthrough]

## Run Specification Tests

```bash
 $ pyenv activate scalyr-2.6.6
 $ pip install -r requirements/test-requirements.txt
 $ lettuce
```
